## Health Monitoring System

An unobtrusive health monitoring system using video-based physiological information is proposed.

## Introduction
The progressive aging population and the prevalence of chronic diseases have emerged as two of the main challenges of the global health care systems. In recent years, the number of people over 65 has increased considerably and it is expected to triple between 2008 and 2060. Nowadays, the chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and disability in the world. These two factors have caused an increase in costs both in intervention and health care. 
In response to these challenges, researchers have been actively seeking for innovative and technological-based solutions to improve the quality of health care as well as to reduce the cost of care through early detection and more effective disease management.
Physiological and activity monitoring are a good and common strategy to detect, control and prevent health diseases through the use of sensors. However, people’s reluctance to use and interact with sensors avoids wide application. Video technology can be used in this context to recognize and monitor physiological data in a unobtrusive and transparent way for the user.

## Proposed solution

The paper '**Unobtrusive Health Monitoring System Using Video-Based Physiological Information and Activity Measurements**' aims to illustrate an innovative approach to pervasive health monitoring based on state of the art technology. The proposed solution is based on two main agents: a non-contact health monitoring system embedded in a mirror-like device and a non-invasive and automatic activity monitoring system embedded in a watchlike device. Heart Rate (HR), Respiratory Rate (RR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV) are extracted from the user’s face by the mirror-like device. Physical Activity (PA) is extracted from the user’s activity by the wearable watch-like device. The health monitoring system proposed in this paper works in an unobtrusive way tracking the user’s health status without interaction.

In this repository, the physiological monitoring subsystem is detailed. The physiological monitoring subsystem is mainly divided in three steps: face detection, ROI detection and tracking and quantification of physiological parameters on forehead ROI.
